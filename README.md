# pc-time-monitor
This is a repository for a project that monitors active time on PC, with the ability to set defined actions after a specified active time.

The UI is in Czech and since this is an old project, the code quality is nowhere near the quality I produce today and so isn't an accurate representation of my current skills. In other words, the code is utter shit (but the program, although highly unoptimized, works).
